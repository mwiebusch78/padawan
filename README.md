## Documentation

[padawan](https://github.com/mwiebusch78/padawan) is a tool for out-of-core
processing of partitioned tabular datasets which are too large to hold
completely in memory. It uses
[polars](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars/py-polars/html/index.html) for
representing and manipulating tabular data in memory and the parquet format
for storing partitions on disk.

The full documentation is hosted at
[readthedocs.io](https://padawan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
